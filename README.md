# The Amsterdam Babysitting Co-op

## What Is This?
During 2014 we tried to organize a group of families in Amsterdam to exchange time as a currency and share childcare support. This project could also have been called, Mission: Date Night.

The origin of the project lies in Brooklyn, NY where my young family was part of a relatively thriving and often dependable babysitting co-op.

## Technical Details
This website (previously based on a Wordpress front-end project) was the source of information about the effort; basically a brochure website that formed the first point of contact between us as organizers and families interested in taking part.

Other services we used to facilitate this project:
- Mailchimp
- SittingAround.com
- Typeform.com
- Google Docs

## Current Status
The project in Amsterdam has been put on hold indefinitely.
